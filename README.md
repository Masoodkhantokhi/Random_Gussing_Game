## Random_Gussing_Game

This is a simple and fun Random Number Guessing Game built using Python.
The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.
After each guess, the game gives a hint to go higher or lower until the correct number is guessed.
I created this project while practicing Python basics. It is perfect for beginners who want to improve their logic and confidence in coding.

#### How It Works

- A random number between 1 and 10 is generated.
- The user keeps guessing the number.
- The program guides the user with hints.
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed.
- Total attempts are displayed at the end.
